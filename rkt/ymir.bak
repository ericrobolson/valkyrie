; The phrase "See:" is used throughout this standard to direct the reader to other sections of the standard that have a direct bearing on the current
; section.
;
; In this standard, "shall" states a requirement on a system or program; conversely, "shall not" is a prohibition; "need not" means "is not required to";
; "should" describes a recommendation of the standard; and "may", depending on context, means "is allowed to" or "might happen".


(define (terms)
  (list 
   'address-unit
   ; Depending on context, either
   ; 1) the units into which a Forth address space is divided for the purposes of locating data objects such as characters and variables;
   ; 2) the physical memory storage elements corresponding to those units;
   ; 3) the contents of such a memory storage element; or
   ; 4) the units in which the length of a region of memory is expressed.
   
   'aligned
   ; Divisible by a type-dependent power of 2 (typically used as "<type>-aligned address" or "<type>-aligned value").
   
   'aligned-address
   ; The address of a memory location at which a character, cell, cell pair, or double-cell integer can be accessed.
   
   'ambiguous-condition
   ; A circumstance for which this standard does not prescribe a specific behavior.
   ; See section 4.1.2 Ambiguous conditions for a list of such circumstances and 3.4.4 Possible actions on an ambiguous condition.
   
   'cell
   ; The primary unit of information in the architecture of a Forth system.
   
   'cell-pair
   ; Two cells that are treated as a single unit
   
   'character
   ; Depending on context, either
   ; 1) a storage unit capable of holding a character; or
   ; 2) a member of a character set.

   'character-aligned-address
   ; The address of a memory location at which a character can be accessed.

   'character-string
   ; Data space that is associated with a sequence of consecutive character-aligned addresses. Character strings usually contain text. Unless otherwise
   ; indicated, the term "string" means "character string".

   'code-space
   ; The logical area of the dictionary in which word semantics are implemented.
